# Ztabilize

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Ztabilize! 

## Overview

Ztabilize is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to provide stability in the cryptocurrency ecosystem through the issuance of stablecoins and robust collateral management mechanisms. Our protocol allows users to mint, redeem, and liquidate stablecoins (referred to as UVA tokens) backed by various collateral assets.

## Key Features

- **Stablecoin Minting:** Users can mint UVA tokens by depositing collateral assets such as USDT, ensuring a 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
- **Redeeming Stablecoins:** Users can redeem their UVA tokens back to the underlying collateral, maintaining stability and liquidity.
- **Collateral Management:** Ztabilize employs a sophisticated collateral management system to ensure the safety and stability of the issued UVA tokens.
- **Liquidation Mechanisms:** The protocol includes robust liquidation mechanisms to protect the system and its users from undercollateralized positions.
